Intiface Central is a frontend application for the [Buttplug Sex Toy Control Library](https://buttplug.io), for Desktop (Win/macOS/Linux) and Mobile (Android/iOS).

For users, it provides simple, friendly capabilites for managing, connecting, customizing devices.

For developers, it allows their application to connect to and control sex toys, without having to worry about constantly updating the underlying libraries or dealing with bugs and crashes in a difficult-to-debug cross langauge environment.
